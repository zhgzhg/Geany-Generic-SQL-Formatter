Short instruction how to add simple keyword formatting:

    1. Register new keyword formatting configuration
       in "lib_fsqlf/kw/kwmap_defaults.def".

    2. Add regexp and tie it keyword formatting configuration
       in "lib_fsqlf/formatter/fsqlf.lex".

    3. To help ensure that it won't accidentally break later, add testcase
       in "tests/cases/<new-or-existing>"
       and "tests/registered_testcases.h".

    4. Ensure that nothing else got broken.
       Execute "make test". (works only on linux)


Note: this instruction works only for simplest cases of formatting,
for more complex case one will need to invest time in analyzing/reading code.
